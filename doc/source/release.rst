Release history
===============

MariaDB Connector/Python 1.1.9
------------------------------

Release date: Dec 22 2023

**Issues fixed:**

- :conpy:`273`: Fixed crash in escape_string method (debug)

- :conpy:`274`: Instead of releasing non freed objects (cursor and connection) in tp_dealloc, they are freed now in tp_finalize to avoid possible crashes

- :conpy:`276`: Allow to retrieve data from buffered cursor if the connection was already closed before

MariaDB Connector/Python 1.1.8
------------------------------

Release date: Oct 12 2023

**Notable changes:**

- :conpy:`271`: Cusor object provides now a metadata attribute, which returns resultset metadata as a dictionary.  metadata attribute also contains information about extended field types like JSON, UUID, INET4/6 and geometry types.

- Added new constants `mariadb.constants.EXT_FIELD_TYPE` which describe extended field types.

**Issues fixed:**


- :conpy:`270`: Data will be converted to Binary only if the character set is binary, the BINARY_FLAG will be ignored.
